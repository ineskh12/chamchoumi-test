# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Movies search app
Test demanded by Hiberus Tecnologia.

### Project description:  

This was a 1 week long project built for Hiberus Tecnologia. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `hookrouter`, `react-icons`, `fuse.js`, `prop-types` and `axios` in order to fetch data from the open API movies library `https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/`.

 ## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
    logo.png
  api/
    listApi.js
  src/
    components/
      Login.js
      Home.js
      Popup.js
      Item.js
      GridItems.js
      SearchBar.js
    hooks/
      useSearch.js
    utils/
      Constants.js
      Routes.js
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.
